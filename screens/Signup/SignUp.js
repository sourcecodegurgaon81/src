                            Notices and Electronic Communications
                            All notices required or permitted to be given under this Agreement will be in writing and delivered to
                            the other party by any of the following methods: (i)hand delivery, (ii)certified U.S. mail, return
                            receipt requested, postage prepaid, (iii)overnight courier, or (iv)electronic mail. If you give notice
                            to N4D, you must use the address shown on the Site. If N4D provides notice to you, it will use the
                            contact information provided by you to N4D. All notices will be deemed received and effective as
                            follows: (i)if by hand-delivery, on the date of delivery, (ii)if by delivery by U.S. mail, on the date
                            of receipt appearing on a return receipt card, (iii)if by overnight courier, on the date receipt is
                            confirmed by such courier service, or (iv)if by electronic mail, 24 hours after the message was sent, if
                            no “system error” or other notice of non-delivery is generated. Each party agrees that any notice that
                            it receives from the other party electronically satisfies any legal requirement that such communications
                            be in writing.
